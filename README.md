# jing_s_data_collectior
This is a data collector for my friend Jingjing, a young lady study in Trinity College Dublin. It helps her to generate specific CSV file from world bank API and other resources.

The data is based on World Bank Open Database, the category file is WDI.CETS.xls, use the second sheet label as your search reference.
